# üìä Indian Government Data Scraper Suite

This repository contains multiple scripts to scrape data from various Indian government data portals like **MOSPI**, **MCA**, **Commerce Ministry**, **IMF**, etc. These scrapers collect important datasets such as **CPI**, **WPI**, **GDP**, **IIP**, and more. The scripts primarily use **Python + Playwright**, and some use `requests`, `pandas`, and `BeautifulSoup`.
